## iOS101 Prework

What I did:
- Added 3 labels
- Added a button that changes the color of the background to a random color when clicked

Some ideas to improve the apps are:
- Improve the UI by using different fonts/colors/background
- Feel free to play around with other elements, such as image views, textfields, etc.
- Implement a way to change the color of the text as well
